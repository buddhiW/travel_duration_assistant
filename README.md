# AI Agent for Travel Duration

This repository contains codes for an AI agent that provides real-time travel duration information between two locations for a given mode of transportation.

The application leverages `OpenAI's Chat Completions` API for natural language processing, `Google Maps Distance Matrix API` for accurate travel duration calculation and `Flask-based web user interface` for easy interaction.
